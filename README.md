# OPS Typing Dashboard

## Introduction
So here's the Ni: 
Keeping track of typing results sucks! Also, but actually mainly, because of tools like Excel and Google Docs. Because after you did all the work of actually inputting the data, all you get is the data.

This tool eliminates that awful feeling with having some cool visual things like graphs and lines.
That's it

## Future plans
1. Create a new way for storing the 512 type in a single column
2. Create a place where public types can be gathered and shared
3. Create dynamic fields for typed people to add attributes like height, hair color, sexual preference
4. Very future: Automatically search for patterns in pool of typed people

### 512 type in a single column
The difficulty with the OPS code is storing it in a database. You don't want to store the full type, because of the issues with searchability.
What if we can create a way to store the full 512 type in a single column that is also:
- Sortable (M over F, N over S etc)
- Searchable (where C > B, where type == ST, where demon == NF)
- Fast (for obvious reasons)

If you're an NT and wants to brainstorm on this:
